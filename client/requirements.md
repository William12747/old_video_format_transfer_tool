## Packages
framer-motion | Smooth list transitions and progress bar animations
lucide-react | Beautiful icons for the UI (already in base but good to be explicit)

## Notes
- Folder selection requires `<input type="file" webkitdirectory directory multiple />`.
- Polling mechanism needed for job status updates (every 2s).
- Preview uses standard HTML5 video tag for MP4 output.
- Dark mode is the primary aesthetic.
